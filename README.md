# UnraveledMCMod #
A server modification for the UnraveledMC server


Please read the following below for the original README. The bottom section is for this mod. As stated below, you may NOT share modified compiled versions of this plugin.
# TotalFreedomMod #

TotalFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official TotalFreedom Minecraft Server](http://totalfreedom.me/). However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (Prozza) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main TotalFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.

# UnraveledMCMod #
UnraveledMCMod was a forked version of TotalFreedomMod. Ivan Morgan, otherwise known as AwesomePinch, then modified it, and OxLemonxO,
RobinGall2910, and CreeperSeth then started to contribute to it along with him. TotalFreedomMod, as stated above, was coded by Steven Lawson (Madgeek1450)
and Jerom van der Sar (Prozza), and was not officially started by Ivan Morgan, or any of the UMC developers. As for rules:

Due to the the TFM license, we are not allowed to release official release jars of the plugin. You will have to compile UMC with eclipse
for yourself!

You are ALSO NOT ALLOWED TO SEND THE COMPILED VERSIONS OF UMC NOR TFM TO ANYONE!!! It is against the rules!
